      <p>January 1991, Tupac, rapper, nationally debuted under the stage name 2Pac, guest on rap group Digital Underground's single "Same Song," compiled on the soundtrack of the February 1991 movie Nothing but Trouble.
      2Pac's first two solo albums, November 1991's 2Pacalypse Now and February 1993's Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..., preceded September 1994's eponymous and only album of his side group Thug Life, himself in it.
      Rapper/producer Stretch guests on the above, three 2Pac projects. 2Pac's third solo album, March 1995's Me Against the World, features rap clique Dramacydal, reshaping as the Outlawz on 2Pac's fourth solo.<p>

      <p>In 1984, Tupac's family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland.[25] He attended eighth grade at Roland Park Middle School, then two years at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. On transfer to the Baltimore School for the Arts, he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet.[26][27] He performed in Shakespeare's plays—depicting timeless themes, now seen in gang warfare, he would recall[28]—and as the Mouse King role in The Nutcracker ballet.[24] With his friend Dana "Mouse" Smith as beatbox, he won competitions as reputedly the school's best rapper.[29] Also known for his humor, he could mix with all crowds.[30] As a teen, he listened to musicians including Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2.
  At Baltimore's arts high school, Tupac befriended Jada Pinkett, who would become a subject of some of his poems.[32] After his death, she would call him "one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime."[33][34] Upon connecting with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA,[35][36][37] Tupac dated the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA.[38] In 1988, Shakur moved to Marin City, California, a small, impoverished community,[39] about five miles (eight km) north of San Francisco.[40] In nearby Mill Valley, he attended Tamalpais High School,[41] where he performed in several theater productions.<p>

      <p>In 1991, angry at record companies' rejections of East Coast artists and the growing popularity of West Coast hip hop, Bronx rapper Tim Dog decided to voice his anger on the notorious diss track "Fuck Compton". It contained shots at the LA rap scene, although he explicitly stated that he was "cool with Ice-T". The music video featured violent threats aimed at Eazy-E. There were several responses from numerous West Coast artists, including the "Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')" which featured Snoop Doggy Dogg dissing Tim Dog (as well as Eazy-E and others), and a separate skit, "$20 Sack Pyramid". Both featured on Dr. Dre's The Chronic album. Compton's Most Wanted responded with "Who's Fucking Who?".
      After the release of "Who Shot Ya?", which Shakur interpreted as a diss song mocking his robbery/shooting, 2Pac appeared on numerous tracks aiming threatening or antagonistic insults at Biggie, Bad Boy as a label, and anyone affiliated with them from late 1995 to 1996. Examples include the songs "Against All Odds", "Bomb First (My Second Reply)" and "Hit 'Em Up". During this time the media became heavily involved and dubbed the rivalry a coastal rap war, reporting on it continually. This caused fans from both scenes to take sides.</p>
